\boldstart{PI Todd Zickler} has been funded through a number of NSF awards to study computer vision. The most relevant are: ``Technological and Educational Foundations for Understanding and Improving Large-classroom Learning'' (IIS-0835338, 2009--2012, \$400,000), which supported the creation of the classroom observation system described in Section~\ref{sec:sys} and some analysis of this data for education purposes; and ``Computer Vision and Online Communities: A Symbiosis'' (HCC-0905243, 2009--2013, \$334,695) which supports research on the complementary problem of improving visual recognition by using a known social network as context. These awards have partially supported two PhD students and two post-doctoral fellows, and produced benchmark datasets for face recognition in personal photo collections~\cite{PintoZickler2011} and several notable publications~\cite{Stone2010,owens2011learning,LiZickler2012,xiong2012pixels,groupdet2013}.
