\boldstart{PI Todd Zickler} has been funded through a number of NSF awards to study computer vision, with the most relevant being ``Computer Vision and Online Communities: A Symbiosis'' (HCC-0905243, 2009--2013, \$334,695). \emph{Intellectual Merit}: This award supported research on how to improve face-based identity recognition using a known social network as context~\cite{Stone2010}; how to learn better object and action appearance models from Internet imagery~\cite{owens2011learning,LiZickler2012}; and how to represent social interactions~\cite{groupdet2013} (including the preliminary results in the present proposal). \emph{Broader impacts:} This award contributed to STEM educator development and the creation of a globally-competitive STEM workforce by partially supporting two PhD students and two post-doctoral fellows. It also enhanced infrastructure for research by produced benchmark datasets for face recognition in personal photo collections~\cite{PintoZickler2011} and interaction analysis in a STEM classroom~\cite{groupdet2013}, with the latter also contributing to improvements in STEM education.

\boldstart{PI Ruonan Li} has not previously been supported by the NSF.
